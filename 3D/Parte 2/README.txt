Robotic arm: turntable (part 2/3) by LimpSquid on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1750025

Summary:
This is the second file publish of my robotic arm series. This component is the turntable of the robotic arm.The following hardware will be needed to assemble the gripper:M3 x 10mm round head(25x)M3 x 8mm round head (8x)M3 x 3mm grub screw (1x)M4 x 3mm grub screw (1x)M4 x ...mm (5x), length for bottom plate bolts will depend on your wooden base plate thickness.10mm x 30mm x 9mm bearing, 6200zz (2x)10mm steel balls (10x)The following electronic parts will be needed:Nema 17 (34mm height) stepper motorBOURNS 3590S 10 turn potentiometerThe assembly should be pretty straight forward, just follow the exploded view. Questions?? Message me!Notes:Print the bearing clamp twice!All critical holes are oversized by 0.25mm to guarantee an easy fit.All the M3 / M4 holes are sized 2.8mm / 3.8mm in diameter. Apply some grease (not necessary, but it makes it easier) on a normal bolt and screw them in the parts with some proper tools. This should make some neat and tight threads in the plastic.While assembling, make sure the potentiometer is rotated to the center (5 turns). Next align the notch of the rotating plate with the potentiometer and push the rotating plate in place.Apply some light oil or grease on the 10mm steel balls.Do not forget to look at the remixes page, there are multiple users that made some cool and useful changes to improve the robotic arm! For example, jackiekk did an awesome job to tweak and provide additional parts to the original design and made it available for both FDM and SLS based printers.
